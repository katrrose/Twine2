&lt;p&gt;}Do you think that the ethics of how a business is run matter?

<p>[[Yes]]</p>

<p>[[No]]</p>Do you care who owns the business?

<p>[[Yes, it's about values and ethos]]</p>

<p>[[Not bothered]]</p>Co-operatives do care about values and ethics, so probably not. Do you think it makes a difference who owns a business?

<p>[[Yes, it's about values and ethos]]</p>

<p>[[No, they're all the same]]</p>Do you care about how a business treats its employees and customers?

<p>[[Of course]]</p>

<p>[[Yes, but prices also matter]]</p>

<p>[[No, just prices]]</p>If who owned a business could affect how it treated its employees and customers, would you care about who owned it?

<p>[[I would care then]]</p>

<p>[[No, still wouldn't]]</p>Would you like to be able to influence how a business makes these decisions without being a rich shareholder?

<p>[[I would]]</p>

<p>[[I wouldn't]]</p>Co-operators do care how a business treats its employees and customers, so you're probably not a co-operator.Would you like to be able to influence how a business makes these decisions without being a rich shareholder?

<p>[[I would]]</p>

<p>[[I wouldn't]]</p>Co-operators do care how a business treats its employees and customers, so you're probably not a co-operator.Would you like to be able to influence how a business makes these decisions without being a rich shareholder?

<p>[[I would]]</p>

<p>[[I wouldn't]]</p>Do you believe others should be able to influence how a business is run as well, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, and wealth?

<p>[[Of course they should]]</p>

<p>[[No, there should be some exceptions]]</p>Would you like to shop with a business where people who care about values and ethics are in charge?

<p>[[I would like to support a business like that]]</p>

<p>[[No]]</p>

<p>[[If they shop there, work there, or contribute to its success - yes]]</p>

<p>[[Doesn't matter if they shop or work there - let the people run it]]</p>

<p>[[No, leave that to executives, they'll do what's best]]</p>Co-operators believe in voluntary and open membership of businesses, for everyone, so you're probably not a co-operator.Do you think that members should get to decide, by voting, on who...(line truncated)...

<p>[[If they're going to run it then yes]]</p>

<p>[[No, leave that to executives, they'll do what's best]]</p>Co-operators believe in members' economic participation, so that only those who have a direct interest in a business determine how it's run; you're probably not a co-operator.&lt;tw-passagedata pid="19" name="No, leave that to executives, they'll do what's be...(line truncated)...

<p>[[Yes, training is important]]</p>

<p>[[No, that's up to them]]Education and training is a core part of co-operation, it might not be for you.If your business had an opportunity to work with another ethical member-owned business and help it, in a way that could help your business too, should it do it?</p>

<p>[[Sounds like a great idea]]</p>

<p>[[No, my business is my concern]]Do you want your community and the people in it to do well too?</p>

<p>[[Absolutely, why wouldn't I]]</p>

<p>[[No, my business is my concern]] This doesn't mean you can't co-operate in other ways, but this is not really co-operative. You are co-operative! You are a born co-operator! </p>
